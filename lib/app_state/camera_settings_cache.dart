/// used to be cached for them (never the capability/volume value itself,
/// which is genuinely live/mutable and always re-fetched live on screen
/// open per the caching convention's "never cache live state" rule), and

/// them here still warms whatever internal state they have and costs
/// nothing extra either way.

/// Best-effort and silent: a call that fails here simply leaves that
/// client's cache empty, and the owning screen falls back to its own normal
/// live fetch on first visit exactly as it did before this existed. Meant to
/// be called `unawaited()`, mirroring `syncCameraFromDevice`'s fire-and-forget
/// use in the add-camera flow — this never blocks add or reports failures of
/// its own.

/// all of these via `Future.wait`, which floods the camera's embedded HTTP
/// server and can turn a single screen open into a many-seconds-to-tens-of-
/// seconds stall (the sibling `nuraeye-rt` app hit and documented this exact
