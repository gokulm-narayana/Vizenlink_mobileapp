/// WAN counterpart to `lan/nuraeye/audio_volume_client.dart`'s `AudioVolumeClient` mic-gain/
/// recording-toggle/test-sound half — `SetMicGain`/`GetMicGain` (`FR-NE-086`) have been
/// `Implemented` and hardware-verified on both LAN and WAN in firmware since 2026-07-28, but
/// `AudioSettingsScreen` never wired the WAN side until now.
///
/// **Recording on/off (`SetAudioRecording`/`GetAudioRecording`, `FR-NE-078`) was previously
/// documented here as "no WAN mirror — stays LAN-only," which was wrong** — the firmware
/// command has been `Implemented` and hardware-verified (`AUD-MQTT-01/02/03`,
/// `TEST.md` §5.44) since 2026-07-28; the app simply never called it. Wired 2026-08-11. The
/// test-tone commands (`playTestSound`/`stopTestSound`/`isTestSoundPlaying` below) similarly
/// stayed LAN-only until `FR-NE-107` (2026-08-11) — reversed by direct user instruction, since
/// a WAN user needs to confirm the speaker works just as much as a LAN one does.
///
/// **Split out of the former combined `WanAudioVolumeClient` 2026-08-11** — speaker volume is a
/// separate, unrelated command group that happened to live in the same class as these; see
/// `wan_speaker_volume_client.dart` for that one. This class kept its original name since it's
/// the majority-share half of the original.
