///
/// **2026-07-31 rewrite (superseded 2026-08-18, see below)**: this used to call AWS IoT directly
/// (SigV4-signed HTTPS publish + MQTT-over-WSS) using this app's own Cognito Identity
/// Pool-federated credentials. Real-device testing found AWS rejects those credentials for
/// `iot-data:Publish`/MQTT-over-WSS with `ForbiddenException`, regardless of IAM policy —
/// isolated by testing the identical role+policy with root/plain-IAM credentials (succeeded) vs.
/// the Cognito-federated session (failed); see
/// `kb/raw/2026-07-31-fix-iot-command-lambda-relay.md`. Went through
/// `cloud_backend/kvs_playback_lambda` (extended, not a second Lambda) instead for a while — same
/// Cognito ID token this app already uses everywhere else, no AWS credentials needed
/// client-side.
///
/// **2026-08-18: reverted back to direct MQTT.** A latency report (the relay's
/// `_publish_and_wait()` costs up to ~12s per command — a brand-new MQTT connection on every
/// single invocation) prompted re-testing the original restriction live; it no longer
/// reproduces (`kb/raw/2026-08-18-fix-direct-iot-mqtt-restored.md` — a real `GetVideoMode` round
/// trip over direct, persistent MQTT completed in 0.43s). See [IotMqttTransport] for the
/// connection itself; this class is now a thin command-catalog + retry wrapper over it, same
/// role `_post()` played over HTTP before.
///
/// **Moved into `camera_api` 2026-08-11** — [idTokenProvider] and related hooks used to default
/// to this app's own `AuthController`/`AwsConfig`; now they default to `WanAuth`'s static hooks
/// instead, so this package never imports anything app-specific. Set
